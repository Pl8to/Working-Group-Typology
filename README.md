# Working-Group-Typology
The approved typology for EC working groups.

**Working Groups** serve as ad hoc organizational units created in response to a pressing issue, opportunity, activity, or deliverable related to moving forward EarthCube goals. Working Groups can emerge from the broad EarthCube community, from under the auspices of a Standing Committee, or by direction of the Leadership Council. They can be initiated by any community member, provided they secure a minimum commitment from at least three participants representing at least three separate institutions. Working Groups may bridge more than one Standing Committee, as they can serve as important mechanisms to foster collaboration and resolve issues between Committees.
